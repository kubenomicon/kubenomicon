# Privilege escalation
The privilege escalation technique is a list of ways that attackers can escalate from their current level of access to a higher level of access. This typically means going from a Pod to taking over a Node or Cluster but can also be escalating from a pod with little permissions to one with higher permissions. Additionally, if a cluster is deployed in a cloud environment, privilege escalation can also include accessing other resources in the cloud environment.
