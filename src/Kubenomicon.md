# What is The Kubenomicon?
![](../images/kubenomicon_cropped.png)

The Kubenomicon was born of a desire to understand more about Kubernetes from an offensive perspective. I found many great resources to aid in my journey, but I quickly realized:
1. I will never be able to solely document every offensive and defensive Kubernetes technique on my own.
2. Things in the Kubernetes world [move really fast](https://kubernetes.io/releases/release/) and there are constantly new attack surfaces to explore. 
My solution to this is to start the Kubenomicon -- a place where offensive security techniques and how to defend against them can easily be documented via pull requests to the Kubenomicon GitHub. 

This project was heavily inspired by the [Kubernetes Threat Matrix](https://microsoft.github.io/Threat-Matrix-for-Kubernetes/) from Microsoft which is a great starting point as it provides a framework to help understand some of the concepts in a [MITRE ATTACK](https://attack.mitre.org/) style framework. The Microsoft Threat Matrix was explicitly not designed to be a playbook offensive for security professionals and thus it lacks the details necessary to actually exploit (and remediate) each attack in Kubernetes cluster.

# Prior work
I am far from the first person to come up with the idea to document this information. Many great projects exist that take a similar approach to this. Most notably what inspired this project was the [Microsoft Kubernetes Threat Matrix](https://microsoft.github.io/Threat-Matrix-for-Kubernetes/). Additionally, late into putting this project together I discovered this amazing [Threat matrix from RedGuard](https://kubernetes-threat-matrix.redguard.ch/). Some other projects that served as inspiration for this include:
- [Kubernetes Hacktricks](https://cloud.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-cloud/kubernetes-security)
